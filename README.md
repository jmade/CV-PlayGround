## Overview

This app was made to help me learn and work with `UICollectionView` and `UICollectionViewLayout`. I was inspired by Tweetbot 3 and its use if UIKit dynamics. 


## Collection View

This ViewController is an example of the wheel card style layout I adapted from some articles i had read. using just random generated colors. the initial size of the card is taken from the screen of the device its being ran on.
*this hack might help it run on newer size screens and in different oreintations.*

## CoverFlow

This rendition features images in place of random colors, images also pan as they scroll by creating a paralax effect. 
*its kinda a horizontal version of the SoundCloud app*


## SnapFlow

This view is designed to be a simple approach to the into of the Tweetbot 3 app 


## New ViewController 

![Alt Text](https://github.com/jmade/jmade.github.io/blob/master/new.gif?raw=true)

This is my adaptation of the `URBMediaFocusViewController`, [here](https://github.com/u10int/URBMediaFocusViewController) 

I added some readouts on the top and a pop down menu to edit and see the live results.
A fun way to interact with things.
